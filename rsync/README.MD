This script sets the source and destination directories, as well as any options that you want to pass to rsync. It then runs rsync with the specified options and directories.

The -a option tells rsync to preserve the permissions, ownership, and timestamps of the files, while the -v option enables verbose output, and the -h option displays sizes in a human-readable format. The --delete option tells rsync to delete any files in the destination that are not present in the source.
